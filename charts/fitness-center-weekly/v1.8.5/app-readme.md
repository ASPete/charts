# fitness-center-weekly

[Aware](https://www.aware.buildinglink.com/) Aware fills the gap in the market between standalone, 
un-managed sensor solutions, and expensive and complex building management systems and platforms

## Introduction

Aware Fitness Center, or Aware-FC is a fitness center management system that reports real-time equipment 
availability information to both residents and management using our custom, self-installable, electronic 
sensor solution.

A component of many Aware solutions is the periodic mailer. Typically this component presents a analytical
 view of data collected during the reporting period and mails the results to subscribed users. 

This chart bootstraps a fitness center weekly report manager deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) 
cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the fitness center weekly report runner, the scalable component that gathers and 
organizes amd prepares the content by solution.
