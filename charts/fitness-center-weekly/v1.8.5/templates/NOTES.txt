fitness-center-weekly has been deployed successfully!

1. In order to begin issuing certificates, you will need to set up a ClusterIssuer
or Issuer resource, and we have set a default ClusterIssuer called `{{ .Values.letsencrypt.name }}` with your register email <{{ .Values.letsencrypt.email }}>.

More information on the different types of issuers and how to configure them
can be found in our documentation:

https://fitness-center-weekly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/issuers.html

2. fitness-center-weekly will create Certificate resources that reference the ClusterIssuer `{{ .Values.letsencrypt.name }}` for all Ingresses that have a `kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` annotation.

For information on how to configure fitness-center-weekly to automatically provision
Certificates for Ingress resources, take a look at the `ingress-shim`
documentation:
