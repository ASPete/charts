## Introduction

A management tool whose theme is based on the 1994 movie [Pulp Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction) and whose goal is to improve the quality of mundane things. Like a five dollar milkshakes a Big Kahuna Burger, Jimmieâ€™s coffee, etc.

Like the characters in the movie, the components of this system implement well defined behaviours.
