## Introduction

A management tool whose theme is based on the 1994 movie [Pulp Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction) and whose goal is to improve the quality of mundane things. Like a five dollar milkshakes a Big Kahuna Burger, Jimmieâ€™s coffee, etc.  

Like the characters in the movie, the components of this system implement defined metaphoric behaviours.

**Lance**

Lance is a drug dealer, who saves the life of Mia Wallace, technically by supplying Vincent with the shot of adrenaline (F5 Routing Rule) that he injects into her heart (the F5).


**The Wolf**

The Wolf is called upon to fix a messy situation in a hurry. He not only manages to get the job done, but he gets it done with grace and style. He's the epitome of cool under pressure

**The Gimp**

Bring out the Gimp. But the Gimp's sleeping...Well, I guess you're gonna have to go wake him up now, won't you? The gimp is a simple test tool that simulates traffic

**Zed**

Zed is a security guard who ultimatly killed by Marsellus Wallace as witnessed by Butch Coolidge, hence the a famous butch line "Zed is Dead" In this implementation Zed represents the storage archive

**Quentin**

The director is in charge of making sure that every component of this system runs smoothly. Generally, the director works on a movie from its inception to its delivery.  
  
As a homage to the pulp fiction director Quentin Tarantino, we cast quientin in the role of directing the actors in this system.
